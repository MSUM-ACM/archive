## I wanna learn more about smaug and its machines!


## lego mindstorms programming
For those who don't know what it is - LEGO MindStorms is a flexible robotic tool kit that comes with an easy to build collection of sensors, motors and a small computer. We have two LEGO windstorm kits that are available for ~~playing~~ learning purposes at the Linux Lab. 

LEGO recently released a new version, the NXT 3.0 , which is slightly more expensive, but comes with more features. That means we get the older version for super cheap on Amazon or eBay. 

Programming on the LEGO Mindstorm is non conventional, because it uses a GUI(Graphical User Interface) based programming environment. But for the most advanced user, the kit can be programmed in C. Google Robot C for more information.

## Cool things you can do on a computer using programming

## Network security, ethics, business management with IT emphases.

## Programming

## App Development

## Unsure, but I'm all ears! I'm interested in this kind of stuff!

## Programming

## Network Management and Security

## Everything i can

## What if you were to have sessions where students could come in and ask questions, such as how do I do this... I don't want to be negative, but going into the computer lab is a bit intimidating. No-one talks to me when I walk into the room and when I try to talk to someone, I feel like I'm intruding ...

Yes thats a great idea. In fact, its so great, we're gonna steal and it. In the meantime, feel free to approach any ACM officers, they would love to get to know you and introduce you around. We'l definitely do a social meet or greet that makes it easier.

## Primary Language of Interest

## How math is used in computer science.

## Any computer science subjects would be great!

## How it applies to real world

## Programming video games.

## I want to learn computer stuff more

## Computer engineering

## web design, network admin, network security, programming in general

## It would be interesting to learn about what makes Operating Systems work.

## parallel processing with cuda
That's a great question - unfortunately I don't know much about CUDA programming...at the moment. I am looking into it though, they have a free course on CUDA programming at Udacity - which is where I am getting started.

Food for thought: would you rather plow a field with 2 strong oxen or 1024 chickens?

## CSIS 316

## I like the Raspberry Pi workshop idea. I bought one over winter break and would like to explore some new ways to use it. Honestly anything to do with computers would be fun for me!

Awesome, what would you think about this - [OwnCloud](owncloud.org) ?
## It doesn't matter to me; I would simply like to expand my knowledge.

## programming in php

## N/A

## How to mine enough bit coins to take over the world haha!!!
How about Doge?

^Justin

## java

## Maybe a workshop for building computers? (Basic and High end such as gaming)

## any other thing thats fun doing

## Animation for programming use, Advanced Website Development, how to set up a server at home and how to host from said server, phone apps and video game development.
