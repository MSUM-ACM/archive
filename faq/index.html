<h2 id="lego-mindstorms-programming">lego mindstorms programming</h2>
<p>For those who don’t know what it is - LEGO MindStorms is a flexible robotic tool kit that comes with an easy to build collection of sensors, motors and a small computer. We have two LEGO windstorm kits that are available for ~~playing~~ learning purposes at the Linux Lab. </p>

<p>LEGO recently released a new version, the NXT 3.0 , which is slightly more expensive, but comes with more features. That means we get the older version for super cheap on Amazon or eBay. </p>

<p>Programming on the LEGO Mindstorm is non conventional, because it uses a GUI(Graphical User Interface) based programming environment. But for the most advanced user, the kit can be programmed in C. Google Robot C for more information.</p>

<p>Yes thats a great idea. In fact, its so great, we’re gonna steal and it. In the meantime, feel free to approach any ACM officers, they would love to get to know you and introduce you around. We’l definitely do a social meet or greet that makes it easier.</p>

<p>That’s a great question - unfortunately I don’t know much about CUDA programming…at the moment. I am looking into it though, they have a free course on CUDA programming at Udacity - which is where I am getting started.</p>
